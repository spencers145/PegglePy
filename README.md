# PegglePy Neural Nets Project

A fork of PegglePy exploring the training of neural networks for optimal play.

This project has been dropped.
Various training methods failed to produce many meaningful results beyond the simplest cases.
The best that was achieved was consistently solving fixed 3-peg levels, and mild improvements over random chance for full games.
